# tl;dr;

CD into the tinyapp directory and install **nodejs** and the Javascript dependencies

    cd **your file path here**/tinyapp
    npm install
    
Start the server in your terminal

    npm start
    
If all goes well you can pull up your preferred browser and head to:

    localhost:8080//

And that should be it! You're free to browse and use the application


## Troubleshooting
If you get errors starting the server make sure you are using nodejs v12
